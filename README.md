2. **Charging Indicators:**

   - A **green LED** indicates that the robot is fully charged (only visible when the bot is OFF).
   - A **red LED** indicates that the battery is currently charging.
   - Ensure the robot can run for approximately **50 minutes** after a full charge.

3. **Battery Specification:**  
   Equipped with a 3.7V, 3200mAh Li-ion single-cell battery for extended operation time.

4. **Power Module:**  
   Supplies stable power to the controller board, sensors, and motors.

5. **Motor Driver:**  
   Dedicated module for controlling the DC and servo motors with precision.

6. **ESP32 Microcontroller:**  
   A powerful dual-core microcontroller that supports both wired (via Type-C port) and wireless communication (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). It handles sensor inputs, motor control, and AI-based algorithms.
